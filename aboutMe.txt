My name is David Krakauer and I'm currently a senior studying CSE at Santa Clara University. Some of my hobbies used to include playing video games, politics, and a bunch more, but recently I've been hyper focused on the job search and doing technical interview practice. While that's been engaging for my mind, I'm really looking forward to getting an offer from somewhere so that I can ease my mind and maybe pick up some of those hobbies again.

Currently, I'm taking the following:
	COEN174 - Software Engineering
	COEN174l -Software Engineering Lab
	COEN319 - Parallel Programming
	PHIL141F - Ancient Philsophy: Cicero
